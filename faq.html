                            <li>Avoid using oil or near fire.</li>

                                The endothelium of the shoe with natural leather color is the nature of the contact areas of the skin fold  may eonal white or light-colored <br>
                                socks should preferably be avoided.

                            <li>In the case of a closed (stitch-down) design, water may permeate, so avoid wearing it in the rain as much as possible.</li>
                            <li>Polyurethane windows are lightweight and have excellent shock absorption, but they are adhered by the press compression method, 
                                so the windows may fall off, but this is not a quality problem.

                            <li>Print technique and pearl pigment coating products are different from dye penetration dyeing technique, so they may fall off when used, 
                            but it is not a quality problem due to the nature of the process.
                            </li>
                            <li>Due to the nature of leather or fabric, repeated wear and tear may cause wrinkles and wear on the product.</li>
                            <li>When other materials come into contact with the patent material, adsorption and color transfer may occur, but this is a unique 
                                characteristic of the material and has nothing to do with the durability of the product.
